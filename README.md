# Support Agent Chatbot for CDP

Welcome to the **Support Agent Chatbot for CDP** project! This chatbot is designed to assist users with "how-to" questions related to four popular Customer Data Platforms (CDPs): Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap. It extracts relevant information directly from their official documentation, providing accurate and helpful responses.
