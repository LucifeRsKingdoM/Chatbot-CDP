# Support Agent Chatbot for CDP

Welcome to the **Support Agent Chatbot for CDP** project! This chatbot is designed to assist users with "how-to" questions related to four popular Customer Data Platforms (CDPs): Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap. It extracts relevant information directly from their official documentation, providing accurate and helpful responses.

## **Project Overview**

### **Objective**

To build an intelligent chatbot that:

- Answers "how-to" questions related to Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap.
- Extracts relevant information from the official documentation of these CDPs.
- Provides accurate guidance to users on various tasks and features.

### **Features**

1. **Answer "How-to" Questions**
   - Example: "How do I set up a new source in Segment?"
2. **Extract Information from Documentation**
   - Fetches relevant instructions directly from the provided documentation.
3. **Handle Variations in Questions**
   - Robust handling of differently phrased or irrelevant questions.

#### **Bonus Features**

- **Cross-CDP Comparisons**
  - Example: "How does Segment's audience creation process compare to Lytics'?"
- **Advanced "How-to" Questions**
  - Handles platform-specific, complex use cases and configurations.
